# Project: authorship attribution

## by: Dekel Mor, Matan Ramati


## Introduction and motivation
We live in changing times: With the way our social media activity increases, we now have a shift away from traditional communication towards a text-based one, and that made facial recognition and voice recognition irrelevant. While these type of messages may have significant advantages and allows us to persist in a globalized world, some question and problem arise we have to face. Undoubtfully, one crucial ability is the identification of an author through its texts; without direct contact, fakes are elsewhere hardly recognizable. The science of identifying authors by there writing is called Stylometry. With our ability to access big data and having sufficient computational power nowadays, the accuracy we may gain in such kinds of tasks is quite impressive.

## the data
our required data is a collection of pairs that contains rich text(not formally, because we want to find differences) and the text author identification. because we wand to classify the text by his author.

we chose to use blog posts data set contain 681,288 posts of 19,320 bloggers (more details about the dataset in the link) : https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/blog-authorship-corpus
